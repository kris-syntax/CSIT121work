    <h1> Why is it important?</h1>

<p>
DCAT is important because it provides a format to describe data catalogs and datasets. It helps to implement<br>
the FAIR guiding data principles and  following these principles helps to identify issues or missing components.<br>
FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. <br><br>

Findable meaning data should be easily findable for people and computer systems.This is made possible by data using<br> 
unique identifiers for example a social security number may be used in a dataset to identify a person because it is<br> 
unique unlike names that can be easily duplicated. Another way is by using metadata to create a description to describe<br>
 the data, and sometimes data is indexed so that it is searched easier.<br><br> 

Accessible: it helps the user if they know how to data can be accessed you can also use authentication method.<br>
Also “Protocols is open, free, and universally implementable”(go-fair.org) so that anyone that has a computer and<br>
internet can access some of the data.<br><br>

To be Interoperable which is the ability for computer systems to work together and exchange information.The vocabulary<br>
 used should be able to be applied broadly to be understood through various applications.<br>

Reusable: these principles should be used in order to make sure that data is optimized so that it can be reused this is<br>
 done by describing data well so that it is then able to be replicated.
