                Government agencies uses DCAT to list agency datasets and APIs. DCAT was actually originally used for publishing <br>
                government data catalogs. Data.gov uses a DCAT schema called Project Open Data Metadata Schema which was <br>
                designed to serve as guidelines for agency datasets and APIs for hosting.The use of data catalog is to grant access to <br>
                 people who are interested in certain data. <br><br>
                
                DCAT-AP is used for European Data Portals, European Data Portal was created to harvest metadata. To harvest metadata <br>
                you would need to use a tool like an API to retrieve the data.DCAT-AP are application profiles which are used in order to <br>
                aggregate content to a single point of access. Dataset users are able to search easier with the help of the DCAT vocabulary.<br> <br>
                
                It is also used in Drupal which is a content management system that is used for creating websites. DCAT is used together<br>
                 with Drupal to extract data such as titles, links and descriptions. After this process it then generates a file which <br>
                 makes the dataset shareable.
