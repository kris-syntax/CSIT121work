<p>
DCAT which stands for Data Catalog Vocabulary which is a W3C standard that was created <br>
so that computer systems or software can exchange and/or use information between data catalogs.<br> 
It’s used in order to publish catalogs on the web and describe data. It also helps to aggregate <br>
metadata from catalogs. <br> <br>

Metadata is used to describe or explain and information resource often referred as “data about data”<br>
(oercommons). Metadata is used for websites, on my blog I create meta descriptions that describe the<br>
article that I am writing about its used for discoverability, its almost like a sneak preview into what<br> 
the web content will be about. 

DCAT is similar in that it is used to describe datasets. DCAT is an RDF <br>
 vocabulary, RDF which stands for Resource Description Framework which is used to for describing 
 <br>data or metadata.
