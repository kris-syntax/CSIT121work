                My name is Kristian I am a part time student returning to CCBC I first attended school at CCBC in spring of 2013 <br>
                after i graduated high school. I did take a web development course back when I was in high school and over the years <br>
                have obtain certifications in HTML and CSS. I had still really enjoyed web development and websites in general so much <br>
                so that I started my own blog. Over the years working remotely and in person I have worked on jobs involving data and <br> 
                databases and I enjoyed that as well so I found that major.
