    <p>Throughout this week I have learned a lot about properly structuring a website.<br> W3 School does a great job of breaking down each section and providing examples to <br> work on and practice quizzes to test your knowledge. Understanding the basic structure <br> was new to in terms of learn what !DOCTYPE was for, I learned that it specified that <br>the document that we are working is a HTML5 document. I'm also a person that likes <br>to make lists so I enjoyed creating ordered and unordered lists. Another thing I also<br> learned was how to link an email.</p>
