      <p id="paragraph">Throughout this week I have learned a lot about properly structuring a website.<br> W3 School does a great job of breaking down each section and providing examples to <br> work on and practice quizzes to test your knowledge. Understanding the basic structure <br> was new to me in terms of learn what !DOCTYPE was for, I learned that it specified that <br>the document that we are working on is a HTML5 document. I'm also a person that likes <br>to make lists so I enjoyed creating ordered and unordered lists. Another thing I also<br> learned was how to link an email.</p>

      <p id="paragraph">This week we learned about <strong>CSS</strong> which stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. I learned a lot different coding techniques that I found to be very useful. First I learned about adding color to the background of a web page.
        Then I learned about adding color to text to add style to your words. I also learned about adding borders and padding around text.</p>

             <p id="paragraph"> During this module I learned about <strong>How to Properly Layout A Website</strong> 
              the materials help me to understand that there are reasons that certain elements are chosen when creating a website.
              This section taught me how important it is to start with your content first then working with it as opposed to against it. 
              I also learned about <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> which can help you do things liek optimize a website for mobile devices.
            Over the years website traffic on mobile devices has increased significantly so it's important to make sure that websites are mobile friendly. </p>
